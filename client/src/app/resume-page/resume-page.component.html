            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                As an experienced frontend developer with over six years of expertise working in both start-up and corporate environments, I have been actively involved in enhancing existing as well as developing new functionalities for a variety of web applications. Throughout my career I have successfully participated in the creation and delivery of exceptional websites and web applications from the ground up.
                After graduating from university I had a two year break from professional growth and served in the army. Following that I decided to gain some knowledge in the rapidly-growing IT field and took a course in web development. I grew increasingly passionate and decided to pursue a career as a web developer and have been working as such since 2017.
                I'm passionate about travelling, new experiences and football. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family and working towards our goals with my wife.
